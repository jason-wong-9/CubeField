# Qube Field
An Android application that is created during nwHacks in a team of three. It allows the user to navigate through 3D space with randomly-generated cubes in a Virtual Reality simulation. This is made purely with Java along with our own implementation of perspective projection that converts a bunch of 3D vectors onto a 2D plane.
